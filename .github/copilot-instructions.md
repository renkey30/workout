Always remember we need to somehow scale to viewport, the goal being the website works and looks good on all device sizes.

blue, black, and white is the website color scheme.

never use !important unless you ask me first

always ensure to code in a future-proof way and layout.

every file should have the css, js, within the same file that is related to it. (SAME FOLDER AT MINIMUM)

always always always, ensure perfect and smart organization on everything.

always debug everything and every step to console with javascript.

DO NOT change any styles, design, or colors of anything already set, unless i say specifically say to change somthito do so. 

im trying to use the firebase for 2 things, 1 for my forum system track posts load posts etc (the entire forum system), and the other for a different system for the registeration and login.

at any point, if you got questions for me, or need me to go check somthing, ASK ME FIRST!

can you always ensure a brief comment in the code at the very top of file just saying what this file mainly is used for / it's purpose?

please always use ids and class names for applying and organizing css to html to add styles to elements easily.
